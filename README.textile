h4. Bees with Machine Guns!

A utility for arming (creating) many bees (micro EC2 instances) to attack (load test) targets (web applications).

Also, retribution for "this shameful act":http://kottke.org/10/10/tiny-catapult-for-throwing-pies-at-bees against a proud hive.

h2. Dependencies

* Python 2.6
* boto
* paramiko

h2. Installation for users

Preferred:

<pre>
pip install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

or, if you must:

<pre>
easy_install beeswithmachineguns
</pre>

h2. Installation for developers (w/ virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper)

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns.git
cd beeswithmachineguns
mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages beesenv
easy_install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

h2. Configuring AWS credentials

Bees uses boto to communicate with EC2 and thus supports all the same methods of storing credentials that it does.  These include declaring environment variables, machine-global configuration files, and per-user configuration files. You can read more about these options on "boto's configuration page":http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig.

At minimum, create a .boto file in your home directory with the following contents:

<pre>
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = <your access key>
aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>
</pre>

The credentials used must have sufficient access to EC2.

Make sure the .boto file is only accessible by the current account:

<pre>
chmod 600 .boto
</pre>

h2. Usage

A typical bees session looks something like this:

<pre>
bees up -s 4 -g public -k frakkingtoasters
bees attack -n 10000 -c 250 -u http://www.ournewwebbyhotness.com/
bees down
</pre>

A bees session where this is being called from a python file, while specifying content type and a payload file.
This is a working example, all of these objects exist in the us-east-1 region.

<pre>
import bees
import json

sOptions = '{"post_file":"data.json","contenttype":"application/json"}'
options = json.loads(sOptions)

bees.up(1,'bees-sg','us-east-1b','ami-5d155d37','m3.medium','ubuntu','commerce-bees','subnet-b12880e8')
bees.attack('<URL TO TEST>',2,2,**options)
bees.down()
</pre>

In this case the data.json is a simple json file, mind the path.

This spins up 4 servers in security group 'public' using the EC2 keypair 'frakkingtoasters', whose private key is expected to reside at ~/.ssh/frakkingtoasters.pem.

*Note*: the default EC2 security group is called 'default' and by default it locks out SSH access. I recommend creating a 'public' security group for use with the bees and explicitly opening port 22 on that group.

It then uses those 4 servers to send 10,000 requests, 250 at a time, to attack OurNewWebbyHotness.com.

Lastly, it spins down the 4 servers.  *Please remember to do this*--we aren't responsible for your EC2 bills.

For complete options type:

<pre>
bees -h
</pre>

h2. Introduction to additions:

h4. Additions contributed Hurl integration and multi regional testing.


  *hurl* is an http server load tester similar to ab/siege/weighttp/wrk with support for multithreading, parallelism, ssl, url ranges, and an api-server for querying the running performance statistics.  *hurl* is primarily useful for benchmarking http server applications.
For more information about *hurl* please visit https://github.com/VerizonDigital/hlx

  Multi regional testing was added so user can call up multiple bees from different regions simultaneously. Users have the ability to “up”, “attack”, and  “down” instances from single command. “regions.json” file is supplied which contains public ami images with hurl pre installed for all regions.


*What kind of changes were made that's different from the old?*
  Instead of writing bees information into a single ~/.bees file, each zone recognized in arguments creates a new unique bees file. Bees.py was modified to read these files. Up, attack, and down functions are run with threads.

example .bees files in user home directory

<pre>
$ ls ~/.bees* | xargs -0 basename
.bees.ap-southeast-1b
.bees.eu-west-1b
.bees.us-west-2b
</pre>


h4. Motivation

Having the ability to generate a lot of HTTPS requests from many different regions around the world allows us to better test our platforms and services. This is also real helpful when there are tools that need to be tested for such things as location of requests.


h4. Hurl Usage


h4. bees up

  Command line arguments are still the same however to add multiple zones with multiple amis, the values must be comma delimited. The ami and zones must also be in same order for it to work. So for example “-i ami-zone1,ami-zone2,ami-zone3 -z zone1,zone2,zone3”.


<pre>
  ./bees up -s 2 -k bees -g bees2 -l ubuntu -i ami-9342c0e0,ami-fd489d
9e,ami-e8c93e88 -z eu-west-1b,ap-southeast-1b,us-west-2b
</pre>

h4. bees attack

  In order to use the hurl platform, --hurl or -j must be supplied. Attacks will run concurrently and return a summarized output. The output is summarized per region. More information can be seen if user supplies the -o, --long_output options.

<pre>
./bees attack --hurl -u $testurl -S20 -M1000 -H "Accept : text/html"
</pre>

h4. bees down

  Bringing down bees is the same and will bring down all bees for all regions

<pre>
./bees down
</pre>


*regions used*: eu-west-1b,ap-southeast-1b,us-west-2b

Some options were added to work with hurl

h4. Examples

<pre>
$ ./bees --help
Usage: 
bees COMMAND [options]

Bees with Machine Guns

A utility for arming (creating) many bees (small EC2 instances) to attack
(load test) targets (web applications).

commands:
  up      Start a batch of load testing servers.
  attack  Begin the attack on a specific url.

  up:
    In order to spin up new servers you will need to specify at least the
    -k command, which is the name of the EC2 keypair to use for creating
    and connecting to the new servers. The bees will expect to find a .pem
    file with this name in ~/.ssh/. Alternatively, bees can use SSH Agent
    for the key.

h2. The caveat! (PLEASE READ)

(The following was cribbed from our "original blog post about the bees":http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/07/08/bees-with-machine-guns/.)

If you decide to use the Bees, please keep in mind the following important caveat: they are, more-or-less a distributed denial-of-service attack in a fancy package and, therefore, if you point them at any server you don’t own you will behaving *unethically*, have your Amazon Web Services account *locked-out*, and be *liable* in a court of law for any downtime you cause.

You have been warned.
